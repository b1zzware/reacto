Boilerplate for Bizzware projects

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`

## Libraries

- [Grommet V2](https://v2.grommet.io)

## Configuration

The boilerplate is already pre-configured by [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), which is enough to develop apps with. Rather than ejecting the configuration, we can customize the configuration with [craco](https://github.com/sharegate/craco).
